## Reflections

### Shooting

## Thoughts on TDD
-What was positive and good about using TDD?
    - TDD made me create more test than I normally would, and helped increase test coverage.
    - It made me think out of the box compared to normal
    - It made my code more robust
- What was Annoying or difficult?
    - I found it annoying that i had to create tests that fail
    - I found it annying that I had to create test that were VERY similar
    - It became a bit repetive which i found annoying
    - I found it difficult to come up with the test without having an implementation first
- What surprised you?
    - How TDD helps you with creating an implementation
- Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thoughtof?
    - I would never have created a test that made me test the input of the user, but because i had to create the test first I had to make that test!
    - I would not have made so many repetive tests
    - I would not have made a test that caught exceptions
